# Data Analysis Portfolio 🎯

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio — a growing collection of projects where I explore datasets, ask questions, clean data, and turn results into clear insights.

Right now, this repo starts with a **Power BI dashboard project**, and I’m actively adding more work in **Python, Excel, SQL**, and other tools as I build new projects.
