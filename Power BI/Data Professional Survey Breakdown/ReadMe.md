# Data Professional Survey Breakdown (Power BI)

Ever wondered what it *actually* looks like behind the scenes of “data jobs”?  
I took a public **Data Professional Survey** dataset and turned it into a Power BI dashboard that tells the story of **who answered**, **what they do**, **what they earn**, and **what they enjoy (or don’t)** about the field.

This started as a guided build from a YouTube tutorial — and I recreated it to sharpen my Power Query + dashboard skills.

## What’s inside the dashboard 🧭
In one clean page, you’ll find:
- **How many people took the survey** + **average age**
- **Average salary by job title**
- **Favorite programming languages** (and which roles prefer what)
- **Where respondents are from** (country breakdown)
- **How hard it felt to break into data**
- **Happiness gauges**: work/life balance and salary

## My “level-ups” while building it ⚡
- Cleaned and shaped survey data in **Power Query**
- Built a simple, readable model for reporting
- Used **DAX measures** for key stats (count, averages)
- Focused on layout + storytelling so insights are fast to spot

## How to open it 🛠️
1. Download this repo
2. Open: **`Data Professional Survey Breakdown.pbix`** in Power BI Desktop
3. If Power BI asks for the dataset location, point it to the Excel file (see credits below) and hit **Refresh**
